// Skills section logic is now moved and combined closely into the About and Experience sections in minimalist portfolios.
// But to keep the structure matching the task, we export an empty or deeply stripped placeholder that acts as a spacer or simple tech list.
// In the current task structure, we will remove the huge visual neon grid and export a simple null to delete its visual weight, 
// as its info is now natively in "About" above.

import React from 'react';

export default function Skills() {
    return null;
